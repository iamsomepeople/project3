# This is Joe Tam's portfolio project 3

## Description
In previous module, I developed a flask application of a restaurant which provided some simple functions like create an order, assigning staff to handle an order, etc.

In this project, I will rewrite it using django framework, here are the criterias I want to achieve in this project:

- Data query using ORM
- some UI (e.g html) to user
- Leverage cloud services, ideally combine serverless function like AWS Lambda into my project
